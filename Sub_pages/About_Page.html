			<center><h1>About my Project</h1><center>
			<center><h4>This project was created to demonstrate the possibility of visually representing exact locations for access control systems. It's a practical application of my skills in digital mapping, design, and systems organization.</h4></center>

		<center><h1>My Story</h1><Center>
		<p><center><h4>I recently rediscovered my lifelong passion for computers and the endless things they can do. It all began in my childhood—around 1986–87—when I was introduced to basic game animation on early Macintosh computers at Shriners Hospital for Children.</h4></center>
		<center><h4>In 7th grade, I had the opportunity to shine by assisting my Computer Science teacher, earning the role of Teacher’s Aid. Fast forward to the early 2000s, I was modifying XML files in a video game and realized I had been coding all along—understanding structure, function, and logic before I even knew what programming really was.</h4></center>
        <center><h4>I’ve always been a quick learner with a great memory for what I study, but I lacked the means to fully pursue my passion—until now.</h4><center>
		<center><h4>Today, I’m enrolled in the Game Developer / Full Stack Software Development Boot Camp at The Tech Academy in Portland, OR. I’m diving into Web Design, 3D Art, Animation, and Software Development, while creating documents, spreadsheets, maps, and functional programs.</h4></center>
		<center><h4>I’m currently learning Python, C++, C#, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I know it’s a lot—but like I said, I’m a quick learner. I’m also gaining hands-on experience with industry-standard tools such as Git, GitHub, IDLE, and Visual Studio Code.</h4></center>
		<center><h4>On top of that, I’m working with both Unity and Unreal Engine—the two top game development platforms—and creating 3D assets with Blender.</h4></center>
		<center><h1>My Goal</h1></center>
		<center><h4>My ultimate goal is to build a successful career in the video game industry or become a software developer—with an awesome side hobby of making video games.<h4><center>
