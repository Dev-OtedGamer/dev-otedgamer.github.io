		<center><h1>My Story</h1><Center>
		<p><center><h4>I recently rediscovered my passion for computers, and the things you can make them do which stems back from my childhood.</h4></center>
		<center><h4>I was taught at the age of 10 (86'-87') how to make basic games(animation) on the early macintosh computers at Shriners Hospital for children.</h4></center>
        <center><h4>In the 7th grade I was able to shine and show the Computer Science Teacher what I already knew and was able to become the Teachers Aid.</h4><center>
		<center><h4>In the early 2000's I was manipulating and creating XML's for a game, it was pointed out to me that this was coding(being able to know what parts did what and change them)</h4></center>
		<center><h4>I have always been a quick learner with a good memory for what I learn, I have just always lacked the means to pursue my passion in computers. Until now.</h4></center>
		<center><h5>My passion has been reignited and I have enrolled into a Game Developer/Full Stack Software Development Boot Camp at The Tech Academy in Portland OR.</h5></center>
		<center><h5>I enjoy doing this type of stuff WebDesign/3D art/animation and creating various Documents/Spreadsheets/Maps and Programs/Functions.</h5></center>
		<center><h5>I'm currently learning Python, C++, C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I know its alot but its like I said "I'm a quick learner".<h5><center>
		<center><h5>I'm also getting the chance to learn and work with alot of the current technolgy industry standard tools/software like Git, GitHub, IDLE, Visual Studio code, etc...</h5></center>
		<center><h5>I'm also currently working With both the two Top Game Engines Unity and Unreal, and creating assets and models using Blender for 3D modeling.</h5></center>
		<center><h5>My ultimate goal is to have a career in the Video Game Industry, or become a Software Developer(With a kick ass hobby of making video games on the side)</h6></center>
