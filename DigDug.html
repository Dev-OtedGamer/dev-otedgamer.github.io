            During that time I was tasked with recreating the classic arcade game Dig Dug, using the Unity game engine and C# with Visual Studio.
            We could only use free assets from the Unity Asset Store. When I couldn't find some assets that were crucial for recreating the game,
            I had to think outside the box and create my own. Using MS Paint I hand drew and colored the dirt tiles, the air pump, and the drill manually.
            I completed the project on time with some time to spare, which I used to explore Unity's animation tools and create a short animation clip for the start screen.

            I Was able to create a Map Genarator that would place the enemies and rocks in random places everytime the game would load the level. I acomplished this
            using C# and Visual Stuido. Here is a small snipit of the code and a short video showing more gameplay and the level generator in action.

            I also went further and created animation for both the continue screen and the game over screen.
