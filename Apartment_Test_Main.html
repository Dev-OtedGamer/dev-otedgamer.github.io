			<div><h1>Welcome to my Apartment tour demonstratin</h1>
			<font size="3" color="black"><p>In this demenstration I want to show how the finished work could look like.</p>
			<div><p>Keep in mind this is a rough frame work for a website and CSS(Cascading Style Sheets) can change many aspects of the way it looks and lays out on the page.</p></div>
			<p>CSS will not change the model photos(only size), CSS will only change how it is dslayed on the page.<p><div></font>
			<font size="0" color="red"><p>This particular application(website) would not work so well on larger scales as each peice of data(Key/Reader/Door/ETC..) could potentially require its own web page. How ever it could be done.<p>
			<p>Plans are in the work to create a executable file(.EXE). This would make it into its own program and would no longer require the web browser.(The user interface would change also and would include search functions).<p></font>
			<h3>How it works:<h3>
			<p>Doors and Areas are along the top of the photo, clicking on one will redirect you to that door page with a brief description of the door and relevant access control methods.</p>
			<p>Keys are along the left side of the photo, clicking on it will redirect you to the door page requiring that particular key.</p>
			<p>Readers down the right side of the photo, clicking on it will redirect you to the door page requiring that particular reader</p>
			<p>Clicking on "Home" on the bottom of the pages will redirect you back to this page(Main).<p>
