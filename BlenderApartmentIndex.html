    <h1>Blender 3D Model</h1>
    <p class="intro">
      <strong>This 3D model was created as a proof of concept to secure a larger project during my time at Microchip Technology while working for Securitas USA.</strong>

      My supervisor mentioned interest in a 3D map of the facility for security purposes. At the time, I had just begun learning Blender 3.6—with no prior experience—but I’ve always been quick to pick up new tools. I offered to create the map, but before I could begin, I was asked to prove I could lead a project of that scale and earn client approval.
      <strong>So in just four days</strong>, I built this model of the apartment I was living in at the time.

    <div class="slideshow-container" id="slideshow-top">
  <img src="Images/apartment-top-view.JPG" class="slide active" alt="Top View 1" />
  <img src="Images/Aprt_Blend_Topview.JPG" class="slide" alt="Top View 2" />
  <img src="Images/Aprt_Blend_Topview_Angle.JPG" class="slide" alt="Top View 3" />
</div>

    <p>
      The model was built to scale using Blender’s grid snapping and unit settings. This allowed for precise layout and realistic proportions.
    </p>

    <div class="slideshow-container" id="slideshow-main">
        <img src="Images/Aprt_Blend_Kitchen.JPG" class="slide active" alt="Kitchen" />
        <img src="Images/Aprt_Blend_Livingroom.JPG" class="slide" alt="Living Room" />
        <img src="Images/Aprt_Blend_Bedroom.JPG" class="slide" alt="Bedroom" />
    </div>

    <p>
      These shots demonstrate the level of detail and the potential for interactivity in the final product.
    </p>

    <div class="slideshow-container" id="slideshow-bathroom">
        <img src="Images/Aprt_Blend_Bathroom.JPG" class="slide active" alt="Bathroom" />
        <img src="Images/Aprt_Blend_Bathroom_Closed_Cabinet.JPG" class="slide" alt="Cabinet Closed" />
        <img src="Images/Aprt_Blend_Bathroom_Open_Cabinet.JPG" class="slide" alt="Cabinet Open" />
    </div>

    <p>
      After presenting this model, the client approved the full project, allowing me to use Blender professionally for three months and gain valuable real-world experience.
