        <p>
            On this project, I was given full creative control to design and develop any game I wanted using Unreal Engine 5, 
            strictly using Blueprints and no C++. I chose to create a <strong>round-based survival first-person shooter</strong> 
            inspired by classic arcade and modern wave shooters.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using the cone shape as a pun for the title, I built much of the game’s aesthetic and character design around it — 
            including cone-shaped enemies and weapons. I focused heavily on game features and systems, implementing modular controls 
            to tweak gameplay variables during runtime, which allowed for smooth player stat upgrades and dynamic balancing.
        </p>
        <p>To enhance progression, I added:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A <strong>vendor system</strong> for purchasing upgrades like fire rate, movement speed, and new weapons</li>
            <li>A <strong>currency drop system</strong> from enemies</li>
            <li>Multiple player <strong>boost mechanics</strong> tied to gameplay milestones</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            When I encountered a bug where enemies could pass through walls and floors, I took a creative approach instead of patching it out —
            I leaned into it and turned the enemies into <strong>ghosts</strong>, giving the game a unique twist and a nod to arcade nostalgia.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sure, zombies are cool — but they’ve been overdone. I wanted something fresher... and a little more spectral. 
            (Shout-out to <strong>One Slice Pizza Man</strong>, if you know, you know.)

            I created modular spawner systems for both enemies and health pickups. These spawners can be placed anywhere in the level, and their behavior is fully 
            customizable through the Details panel in the hierarchy — allowing you to set the item type and spawn intervals.
            Below is a short video showcasing some gameplay and these features in action.

            Here's additional gameplay footage demonstrating how the rifle, while less accurate than the pistol, delivers greater impact — 
            especially when fire rate upgrades aren't applied. You’ll also see the body armor system in action, showcasing its defensive benefits during combat.

            The Game Over screen is fully implemented as well, providing a clean and functional end to each run.
